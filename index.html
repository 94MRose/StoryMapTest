      <h2>What is The Land Between?</h2>
      <div id="top"></div>
      <p>The Land Between is a bioregion in central Ontario extending from the Frontenac Arch in the East to the Georgian Bay, and up to southern Parry Sound.  From East to West this belt spans more than 240km and is more than 40km wide on average.  It's irreplaceable ecosystems provide many benefits to the region and serve as a critical refuge for many of Ontaio's wildlife species. However, the region's fragile balance is highly susceptible to urban sprawl and habitat loss which compromise long-term stability. For reference the boundaries of The Land Between will be displayed as a dashed outline while we explore some of it's unique features.<br><br> For a more in depth description see <a href='https://www.thelandbetween.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/What-Do-You-Mean-The-Land-Between.pdf '>What Do You Mean The Land Between?</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="contents north">
      <h2>Bedrock</h2>
      <p>Bedrock acts as the foundation to any ecosystem. The Land Between acts as a transition zone between the Canadian Shield and the St. Lawrence Lowlands. These transition zones are called ecotones. Ecotones possess both the characteristics of the ecosystems they border and offer unique interactions between a large variety of environments and species resulting in an area of high biodiversity. <br><br> For more information on how the boundary was defined see <a href='https://www.thelandbetween.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/The-Land-Betwen-Boundary.pdf'>The Land Between Boundary</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="contents north">
      <h2>Physiography</h2>
      <p>Serving as an important wildlife refuge, the wild lands of The Land Between are far more intact compared to the south. The conditions in this area have given rise to some of the highest habitat diversity in Ontario. Many geologists are drawn to the area for it’s unique mineral composition. The area is predominated by shallow soils, often less than 15cm of soil cover, increasing risks for environmental damage. Thin soil has lower absorptive capacity, and a limited capacity to filter water. These limitations are important considerations for increasing development in the area.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="contents north">
      <h2>Shorelines</h2>
      <p>The Land Between has more shoreline to area than anywhere else in Ontario. Shorelines and wetlands are critical to the life cycles of many of Ontario’s reptiles, amphibians, and insects. However, the interconnectedness of these waterways increases the area’s susceptibility to contamination.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="contents north">
      <h2>Biodiversity</h2>
      <p>Biodiversity is an important marker for healthy and functioning ecosystems. Higher biodiversity translates into more capacity to withstand climate change and to maintain ecosystem functions, and therefore greater well-being for people. Biodiversity results from more species interacting within the food web. The Land Between acts as both the northern limit for many southern species as well as the southern limit for northern species. Many rare and unique species also rely on this region for survival.<br><br>This map displays the spatial pattern of land cover diversity as measured by the Simpson’s Diversity Index. Method at a scale of 5Km2. The two blues represent the highest vegetation diversity.</p>

      <h2>Inhabitants of The Land Between</h2>
      <p>The Land Between is home to a wide range of important species. This region has many unique species interactions, as it is the meeting place of many northern and southern species. We have selected 20 of these species that we'll briefly introduce below as well as the areas they have been observed. Currently displayed is the number of different species, out of the 20 we've selected, that have been observed in each 10km x 10km tile. Observations for each individual species will be shown below.</p>

      <a href="Media/Blanding.png" data-lightbox="Blanding" data-title="Blanding's Turtle (Emydoidea Blandingii)"><img src="Media/Blanding.png"></a>
      <h4>Conservation Status: </h4> <p>Endangered in Canada since 2016 / Threatened in Ontario since 2008<br><br></p>
      <h4>Identification: </h4><p>
          • Medium-sized turtle, carapace length of ~ 20-23 cm<br> 
          • Domed (army helmet-shaped), black to dark brown carapace with small yellow flecks <br>
          • Bright yellow chin and throat <br>
          • Yellow plastron with black patches along the outer edge of each scute<br>
          • Plastron hinge is located near the front <br> <br> </p>
        <h4>Info:</h4>
        <p>The Blanding’s Turtle is divided into two populations in Canada: the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence population that ranges from southern and central Ontario into southern Quebec, and the Nova Scotia population. During the active season, Blanding’s Turtles spend their time foraging, basking, and moving between habitats. They often travel great distances on land. Blanding’s Turtles have a preference for nutrient-rich, slow-moving, shallow water bodies with abundant aquatic vegetation and basking sites. They bask on rocks and logs just above the water’s surface as well as in sunny, open areas on land. Blanding’s Turtles typically nest in open areas with full sun exposure such as shorelines, forest clearings, or rocky outcrops. They will also nest on human influenced sites, such as gardens, gravel roads and road shoulders. Blanding’s Turtles overwinter in habitats with shallow, un-frozen water and can tolerate extremely low levels of oxygen.</p>

      <h4>Conservation Status: </h4><p>Listed as Special Concern in Canada since 2012 and in Ontario since 2014<br><br></p> <h4>Identification: </h4><p>
      • Small turtle; carapace length rarely exceeds 13 cm <br>
      • Narrow, domed, brown to black carapace with dark spots or streaks <br>
      • Carapace is often covered in algae<br>
      • Plastron is yellow-brown with some scutes separated by skin<br>
      • Plastron hinge is located near the front <br>
      • Pointed snout with two light stripes extending from the nose across each side of the head  <br>
      • Two or more barbels on the chin and throat <br> <br></p>
      <h4>INFO:</h4> 
      <p>In Canada, the Eastern Musk Turtle’s range extends from southern Ontario, north to Sudbury and North Bay, and to the southernmost parts of Quebec. The Eastern Musk Turtle is a highly aquatic species that rarely leaves the water except to nest or to access adjacent wetlands. They are most active at dusk and dawn, avoiding the midday sun by basking just below the water’s surface under the cover of floating vegetation. Eastern Musk Turtles are most commonly found near the shores of well-vegetated, shallow waterways with slow currents such as; rivers, bays of lakes, marshes and ponds. They overwinter in shallow waters, burying themselves in the bottom substrate and will occasionally use the burrows of other animals, or muskrat and beaver lodges. During the nesting season, females dig shallow nests in decaying plant matter, rotting wood, or sand and lay 2 to 5 eggs. When disturbed Eastern Musk Turtles will attempt to scratch and bite, and may release a foul, musky-smelling fluid from glands located on the underside edges of the carapace. This predator deterrence is how the Musk Turtle got its name. </p>

      • Large, dark blotch behind each eye<br>
      • Flattens neck when threatened<br><br></p>
      <h4>INFO:</h4>
      <p>Within Canada, the Eastern Hog-nosed Snake occurs only in south-central Ontario and can be found in sandy soil environments like beaches, wooded areas, and meadows. They are active predators and highly mobile with a large home range. There is little known about how Eastern Hog-nosed Snakes hibernate, but they have been observed digging individual hibernacula when pre-existing burrows are not available. They lay their eggs in sandy soil beginning in June, and eggs hatch about two months later. The Eastern Hog-nosed Snake is harmless but puts on an elaborate display when threatened, often alarming humans. Along with a cobra-like display of flattening their neck, this snake will also play dead by rolling onto its back, emptying its bowels and releasing blood out of its mouth and cloaca.</p>

          <h4>INFO:</h4>
      <p>Common Nighthawks are a migratory species that breed throughout most of mainland North America, and overwinter in South America. They breed throughout Ontario, but most sightings have been  along the southern edge of the Canadian Shield, in the Niagara region, and near Thunder Bay. Common Nighthawks are ground nesters that breed in a variety of open landscapes devoid of vegetation such as forest clearings, sand dunes, rocky outcrops, and gravel rooftops. Early into European settlement in North America, Common Nighthawk populations likely increased with  the newly deforested land and introduction of gravel rooftops, however, with continued settlement, the amount of available habitat is declining.</p>

          • Males have orange jaws during breeding season<br>
          • Only lizard native to Ontario<br><br></p>
          <h4>INFO:</h4>
      <p>In Canada, the Five-lined Skink occurs only in Ontario on the southern Canadian Shield and in southwestern Ontario. Five-lined Skinks prefer habitat with a relatively open canopy, rocky outcrops, and new plant growth. They spend the majority of their time under the cover of rocks and logs, but can be seen basking on cooler mornings. They move quickly and when threatened will flee or “drop” their tails as a way to escape predators, leaving their tail behind. Five-lined Skinks have no defined home range and are not territorial. They hibernate communally under rocks and decaying wood, and sometimes even nest communally. Females lay their eggs under rocks or debris in early summer and sit with their nest to defend it from predators. </p>

      <p>The Eastern Whip-poor-will is a migratory species that breeds in most of northeastern United States, and from central Saskatchewan into the Atlantic provinces. In Ontario, much of their breeding population is concentrated in the Land Between, along the Georgian Bay coastline, and up to the northern edge of Lake Superior. Eastern Whip-poor-wills overwinter in southern parts of Florida, eastern Mexico and parts of the Carribean into Panama. They require forested areas next to open landscape to swoop down and forage for insects. Preferred habitats have sparse, irregular trees with good perches such as; forest edges, pine plantations, and regenerated forests after a fire.</p>

          • Females have similar markings but mask and throat are grey<br><br></p>
          <h4>INFO:</h4>
      <p>The Golden-winged Warbler is a migratory species that breeds in much of the north-eastern United States, southern Ontario, and the edges of Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Quebec. They overwinter in Central America. Roughly 79% of the Canadian population breeds within the Land Between. Golden-winged Warblers require habitats of new vigorous growth within close proximity to large mature forests, and an understory of weeds and shrubs. This is typically found where cleared lands are regrowing into forests, as well as in wetlands. After fledging, these birds move into mature forests with dense cover to protect themselves from predators such as hawks.<br><br>
      In the Land Between, shoreline development is altering the treed wetland habitat in which the Golden-winged Warbler is most often found. This local threat could have substantial consequences for the Ontario population.<br><br>
      The Golden-winged Warbler often competes and mates with the Blue-winged Warbler, producing viable offspring. The hybridization of these two is called the Brewster’s Warbler (when the hybrid appears grey like the Golden-winged Warbler) or the Lawrence’s Warbler (when hybrid appears yellow like the Blue-Winged Warbler). Due to land clearing for agriculture, the Blue-winged Warbler has moved further north into the Golden-winged Warbler’s range, increasing the likelihood of hybridization. Over generations the Blue-winged Warbler is replacing the Golden-winged Warbler.</p>

          • Call sounds like running a finger across the teeth of a comb <br>
          • Distinguishable from Boreal Chorus Frog by call and separate range<br><br></p>
          <h4>INFO:</h4>
      <p>In Canada, the Chorus Frog occurs only in southern Ontario and southwestern Quebec (the Boreal Chorus Frog occurs in northern Ontario and the central provinces). Chorus Frogs are poor swimmers and only spend about 20 days of the breeding season in aquatic habitats. They are one of the first frogs to call in the spring, sometimes as early as March, and can start breeding before the water is free of ice. Chorus Frogs lay their eggs in shallow, often temporary water bodies such as flooded fields, ditches, and swamps to avoid aquatic predators. Terrestrial habitat is often selected based on proximity to breeding ponds, but grassy or wooded areas near water, or damp, open habitats are preferred. Chorus Frogs are freeze-tolerant and hibernate under rocks, logs, leaf litter, and loose soil. Currently shown on the map is observation counts ranging from 1 to 35 seperate observations, with darker squares representing a larger number of observations.</p>

          • Has longer legs than most other canids<br>
          • Very dense fur consisting of a short undercoat and long, coarse guard hairs which determine its colour<br><br></p>
          <h4>INFO:</h4>
      <p>Wolves live in a variety of habitats but their range has been significantly reduced by humans. They work in packs to hunt large herbivorous mammals such as deer and moose. Canada is an important stronghold for the species and wolves are a protected species in national parks.</p>

          • colour can vary but is predominantly light grey and red, interspered with black and white<br>
          • Typically smaller than wolves, with longer ears<br>
          • Muzzle forms an almost continuous line with the forehead<br>
          • Yellow slanting eyes with black round pupils<br>
          • Paws are more elongated than most dogs<br><br></p>
          <h4>INFO:</h4>
      <p>Coyotes prefer open or semi-wooded habitats. They often bed down in thickets. They often travel long distances, up to 16km per day and are competent swimmers. Although often persecuted by humans, their range has greatly expanded as populations of wolves and cougars dropped. People have also created many conditions that benefit them such as the clearing of forests, provision of carrion, and introducing domestic livestock.</p>
